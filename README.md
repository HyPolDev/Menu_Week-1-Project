## 📄 Add Ons - Bugs and Dreams

Project finished on a polishing state, it is posible to find bugs, probably with the "reservation" page buttons.
I'm no graphic designer to this date however I still belive the styling of this web complex can be perfected with minimal changes, and I encourarge you to perform them.
